This folder demonstrates the generation of tables of constants involved in our implementation.

In each of the following folders:
- `m3/ntt_barrett`
- `m3/fnt`
- `avr/ntt_barrett`
- `avr/fnt`
typing
`make` will produce the binary `gen`
Typing `./gen` to generate tables of constants and compare them to the ones used in our implementations.
(`avr/fnt` provides `test_fnt257`, `test_fnt769` binary instead of `gen`. )
